<h3><p>This is the pesto manifesto; an improvised recipe of sorts.
	<br>
	When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:
	<br>
	<p></h3>
	&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h4>Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.</h4>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h5>Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.</h5>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h6>Must use pine nuts.</h6>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h5>No food processing allowed.</h5></p>
<br><h4>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.
	<br>Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! Or should it?</h4>
	<br>

	&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h3>Become inspired by mediocre productions.</h3>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h2>Don’t covert production and  experimentation recipe.</h2>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h1>Always leave the edges rough, so that  someone can cut themselves.</h1>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h2>A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.</h2>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h3>Take the knife to cultural icons and  produce: produce the produce for the  recipe and destroy the recipe.</h3>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<h4>Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe;  pun and play, annihilate and resurrect  meaning.</h4></p>
<br>
<strong>
<p>		<h5>Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh.</h5></p>
