<strong>
		The Pesto Manifesto
		</strong>
		<br>
		Peter Nowogrodzki
		<br>
	<p>This is the pesto manifesto; an improvised recipe of sorts.
		When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
	<br>
	<p>1. Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.</p>
	<p>2. Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.</p>
	<p>3. Must use pine nuts.</p>
	<p>4. No food processing allowed.</p>
<br>
	<p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.
Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! Or should it?</p>
<br>
	<p>1. Become inspired by mediocre productions.</p>
	<p>2. Don’t covert production and  experimentation recipe.</p>
	<p>3. Always leave the edges rough, so that  someone can cut themselves.</p>
	<p>4. A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.</p>
	<p>5. Take the knife to cultural icons and  produce: produce the produce for the  recipe and destroy the recipe.</p>
	<p>6. Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe;  pun and play, annihilate and resurrect  meaning.</p>
	<p>		Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh.</p>
