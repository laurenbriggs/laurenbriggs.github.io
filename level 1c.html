<p>This is the pesto manifesto; an improvised recipe of sorts.
	<br>
	When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:
	<br>
<p> 1. Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.
<br> 2. Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.
<br> 3. Must use pine nuts.
<br> 4. No food processing allowed.</p>
<br>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.
	<br>Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! Or should it?
	<br>
<p> 1. Become inspired by mediocre productions.
<br> 2. Don’t covert production and  experimentation recipe.
<br> 3. Always leave the edges rough, so that  someone can cut themselves.
<br> 4. A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.
<br> 5. Take the knife to cultural icons and  produce: produce the produce for the  recipe and destroy the recipe.
<br> 6. Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe;  pun and play, annihilate and resurrect  meaning.</p>
<br>
<strong>
<p>		Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh.</p>
