	<p>This is the pesto manifesto; an improvised recipe of sorts.
		<br>
		<br>
		<em>When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:</em>
		<br>
		<p> <!-- Lists -->
<ol>
  <li>Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.</li>
  <li>Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.</li>
  <li>Must use pine nuts.</li>
	<li>No food processing allowed.</li>
</ol>
</p>
	<br>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.
		<br>Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! Or should it?

		<!-- Lists -->
<ol>
  <li>Become inspired by mediocre productions.</li>
  <li>Don’t covert production and  experimentation recipe.</li>
  <li>Always leave the edges rough, so that  someone can cut themselves.</li>
	<li>A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.</li>
	<li>Take the knife to cultural icons and  produce: produce the produce for the  recipe and destroy the recipe.</li>
	<li>Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe;  pun and play, annihilate and resurrect  meaning.</li>
</ol>

	<p>		Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh.</p>
